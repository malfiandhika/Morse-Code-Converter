# Morse-Code-Converter
Morse Code Converter is a MATLAB program that is used to convert alphabetical words to morse code and vice versa. This program also has a feature to process the morse code output into its sound. This program is a code reverse engineering that I found the video on YouTube. I learned the concept and translated it into Bahasa.
